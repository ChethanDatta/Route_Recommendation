# Route optimization using Machine Learning

------

Route optimization using ML is a technique to improve path prediction using LightGBM and Gentic algorithm

This project uses 
Python
Jupyter notebook

You can run this project by following the below steps:

Make sure you have installed python3

installing dependencies
```
pip install lightgbm
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install pickle
pip install xgboost
pip install gmplot
```

Now, that the node modules are installed.

Open the Train LightGBM Model.ipynb file and run all the cells.
This will create a .sav file of the model, which is being imported in Genetic algorithm.

Open the Genetic Algorithm.ipynb and run all the cells.
This will give you an optimized path as output.
